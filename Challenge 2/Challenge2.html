	<h1> Hanah Billups </h1>
	<h2> Sophomore</h2>
	<h2> Supply Chain Management </h2>
		<p> I am originally from Stockbridge, Georgia located fifteen minutes outside of Atlanta, Georgia. I am nineteen years old soon to be twenty years old, as my birthday is in one week. I come from a relatively large family despite the fact that I only have one sister. None of my family originates from Georgia. They are all quite excited that I branched out and decided to come to Washington, D.C. </p>
		<p> Now that I am attending Howard University, I run Varsity Track and Field. I am currently a captain for the team. I do not party much. For leisure I like to eat, explore, or just kickback with friends. None of my friends came up here with me from Georgia. Therefore, all of my friends are new and from all across the world. My eyes have already been opened and my mindset broadened after my short time at Howard University. </p>
